# Script used to make the tedious tasks of transferring a user from 1 server to another, less annoying as it already is
# This is when they may have information spread across 2 different servers. This is the second part of a 2 part script to do the transfer.

# Issue with Desktop and My Documents is it is handled by folder redirect. Copying from standard user account doubles up and causes problems.

# Target the folder redirect. This can only be done as the user.
